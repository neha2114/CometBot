# CometBot
HackUTD 2021 Project, by Angela Chen and Neha Sapre

Our discord bot was created to aid students and professors in a virtual classroom setting. First, the bot allows professors to add a class to the server, then students can join the class. In a remote setting, it can be hard for professors to know which students are engaged in class, and for students to feel motivated to go to class. The bot allows professors and students to track their class attendance, by keeping "streaks", allowing for students who attend class regularly to be recognized for their consistent participation. In a friendly competition, students with the top attendance records can be recognized for having participated more frequently. 

Additionally, the bot provides a feature for students and professors to create class events, such as study groups, group review/tutoring sessions, and more. This will make it easier for students to form study groups than in other similar messaging apps. Also, since Discord is popular among students, professors will get to engage with students more and see a higher turnout for review sessions and tutoring events set up through our bot.
